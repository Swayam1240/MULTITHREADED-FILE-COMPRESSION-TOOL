#DESCRIPTION : This C++ program is a multi-threaded file compression and decompression utility 
               using the zlib library. It reads an input file, compresses it in chunks using 
               multiple threads, and writes the compressed data to an output file. It also 
               supports decompression using a similar multi-threaded approach.
  KEY FEATURES : 1. Multi-threaded Compression
                 2. Multi-threaded Decompression
                 3. Threading
                 4. File Handling
